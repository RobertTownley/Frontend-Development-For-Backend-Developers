#Introduction
Hi everyone. How's it going? I'm asking collectively. Obviously I don't have time right now to ask you all individually,
so I've got to settle for a weird, collective "Woo" noise and applause.

But you know what? That woo noise is important too. The overall mood of the room, the elasticity of your collective
minds, the total amount of caffeine you've all consumed today... those are every bit as important as the content of what I'll be talking about today.
Next week, we'll all be back at work and your colleagues will ask you how your conference went, and you'll say
"Well there was this American guy who made a few jokes about cowboys, and said some stuff about frontend development"
They probably won't care much about the cowboy stuff, but they'll ask about the frontend stuff. And when they do,
whatever you've retained will be because you agreed, through the verbal contract known as a "Woo" noise, to gift me with
your attention.

That is a vote of confidence that I'll be able to give you something useful over the next half hour, and I promise that
I'll try my best to do so.

## Will Rogers
Today we're going to talk about ways to integrate some frontend tools into your Django projects. As we do so, I'm also going to introduce you to a man named Will Rogers.

But first, I promised you some cowboy stuff.

Last year, I married a woman from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

I'd like to start things off by introducing you all to a cowboy.

## Thank you
Thank you all for taking time out of your schedules and lives to hear me speak. It's a vote of confidence in me that
I'll be able to teach you something useful, and I promise that I'll try my best to do so.

This is my first time speaking at a conference,
